# My simple Admin Dashboard

Admin dashboard with internal mail system.

Check the Live Demo depolyed on [Vercel](https://my-first-admin-dashboard.vercel.app/)  

## How It's Made:
**Tech Used:** React , CSS , Recharts , React-icons , React-router-dom
<br />
<br />
With the help of react router package , this is a SPA admin dashboard using charts from Recharts package to showcase the analytics of the data available. The react application is a simple one and avoids complexity. 

## What's left:

The state management should be implemented with Redux for more readability. Also the data used to showcase the page is all temp and fake data found on the data src/data dir , so It would be convenient to possibally have a simple backend and database and a REST API. Tailwind could also help the readability of the source code but it's not a priority right now.       


## How to run:
This is based on vite so for development:
```
npm run dev
```
and for production: 
```
npm run build
npm run preview
```
